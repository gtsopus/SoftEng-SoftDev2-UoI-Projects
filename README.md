### This repository contains two projects created under the supervision of Associate Professor Apostolos Zarras for his CSE, University of Ioannina courses: "Software Engineering" and "Software Development 2"

* Text2Speech-App: Text2Speech App is a desktop application developed with Java as a project for Software Engineering, an undergraduate course in Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Ioannina (2020). It is a simple text editor with the ability to read the text to the user. It was developed with the intent to learn: agile software development, unit testing and a couple of different applicable design patterns. 
University project for the "Software Engineering" course made in collaboration with my friends and colleagues G. Tarasidis and Ph. Papachristou.

* Minnesota Income Tax Calculation Project: Minnesota Income Tax Calculation Project is a desktop application created by previous years students for the course of "Software Engineering".
Our goal was to improve and apply refactoring techniques to this legacy code and refactor it accordingly. It was created as a course project for Software Software Development 2, an elective undergraduate course in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Ioannina (2020-2021) made in collaboration with my friend and colleague G. Tarasidis.
