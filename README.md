Text2Speech App is a desktop application developed with Java as a project for Software Engineering, an undergraduate course in Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Ioannina (2020). It is a simple text editor with the ability to read the text to the user. It was developed with the intent to learn: agile software development, unit testing and a couple of different applicable design patterns. Made in a team with my colleagues  and friends G. Tarasidis, Ph. Papachristou.
